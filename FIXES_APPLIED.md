# 🔧 Issues Fixed - Candidate Details & PDF System

## ✅ Issues That Were Fixed

### 1. **"Candidate Not Found" Error**
**Problem:** CandidateDetails component was using old localStorage system instead of API

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Updated `CandidateDetails.tsx` to use `applicationService.getById()` 
- ✅ Added proper API calls with error handling
- ✅ Added fallback to localStorage when backend is unavailable
- ✅ Improved loading states and error messages

### 2. **PDF/Resume Upload & Viewing System**
**Problem:** Resume upload, viewing, and downloading weren't working properly

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Updated resume viewing to open files from backend: `http://localhost:5000/uploads/filename`
- ✅ Added proper resume download functionality
- ✅ Show "Resume uploaded" or "No resume uploaded" status
- ✅ Proper error handling when no resume is available
- ✅ Files are served by Express static middleware

### 3. **Skills Display Issues**
**Problem:** Skills might be stored as string or array depending on source

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Added proper handling for both string and array formats
- ✅ Automatic conversion of comma-separated strings to arrays
- ✅ Fallback display when no skills are provided

### 4. **API Integration**
**Problem:** Components were still using localStorage instead of database

**Fixed:**
- ✅ All CRUD operations now use the API
- ✅ Proper error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ Data is now saved permanently in MySQL database

## 🎯 How It Works Now
